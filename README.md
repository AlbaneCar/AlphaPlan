# AlphaPlan

## Description

The **AlphaPlan** is a web application developed to manage the **GL Project** within the Software and Data (LD) track at ESEO engineering school. This application facilitates the management of students, team creation, sprint tracking, project grading, and enables all involved users (students, project leaders, mentors, etc.) to interact with the system in a secure and smooth way.

The primary goal is to replace the current manual and time-consuming processes by automating tasks like team creation, performance evaluation, and grade management.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can log in with credentials and access specific information based on their roles (students, project leaders, mentors, etc.).
- **Team Creation**: Project leaders can import student lists and assign them to teams automatically based on criteria such as gender and grade average.
- **Sprint Management**: Define sprints, track progress, and manage sprint completion protocols.
- **Project Grading**: Instructors and mentors grade team projects (technical management, project management, compliance).
- **Bonus/Malus Management**: Assign and manage bonuses or penalties for students based on individual performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: JavaScript (with a framework Vue.js)
- **Backend**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
